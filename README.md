# SaferClone
This repository is a fork of AstralClone where I compile it for my friends. It's not really "safer" if you don't know me in game and trust me.

Credits for 99% of the work goes to the upstream repository and its readme is pasted below.

# AstralClone
Ignores `APIUser::allowAvatarCloning` via hooking

# Advantages:

- Runs only once at application start

# Todo:
- [ ] Unpatching
- [ ] MelonPreferences
